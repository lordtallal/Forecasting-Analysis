Forecasting Analysis Dashboard (Personal Project)

This is a Google Data Studio dashboard I created to visualize the results of my forecasting analysis for a personal project. The dashboard includes charts and tables that summarize the forecasted values for various key performance indicators, such as revenue, expenses, and profitability.

The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use for non-technical stakeholders, such as executives, investors, or analysts. It includes clear explanations of the forecasting methodology and assumptions, as well as annotations and comments to highlight key insights and trends.

Overall, this dashboard provides a powerful tool for decision-making and planning, by providing accurate and reliable forecasts of its financial performance. It can be used for budgeting, investment analysis, risk management, and strategic planning, among other applications.

Feel free to to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for your interest in this project!
